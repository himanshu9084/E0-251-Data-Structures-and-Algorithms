Solving a maze in matrix form using persistent stack.

1)	Maze generation : 
	On input 0, a maze will be created for the input value of n.

2)	Maze Solving :
	On any other input, maze will be solved. Enter the file name as maze/filename.
	The output will be shown as a combination of Right and Down directions.
	Maze traversal starts at (0,0) and ends at (n-1,n-1) in maze matrix.
