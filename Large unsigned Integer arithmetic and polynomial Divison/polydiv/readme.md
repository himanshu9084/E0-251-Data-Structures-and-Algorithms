1) Work flow : 

	Step 1 : 
		For polynomial divison press any number but not 0.
	
	Step 2 :
		On pressing 0
		Polynomial input and output takes place.
		
	Step 3 : 
		On pressing any key apart from 0
		Infinite computation of polynomial divison takes place.
	
	
2) Function description :

	*	main()
		main() is taking input that whether you want to do infinite computation or not.

	*	struct node{..}
		Defining the structure for doubly linked list for storing polynomial.

	* 	insertsort(..);
		function is inputting data in a sorted manner into doubly linked list polynomial.
	
	*	struct node* create(..);
		creating a linked list node.

	*	insertpoly(..);
		inserting polynomial.

	*	divide(..);
		Dividing polynomials.

	*	print(..);
		printing the polynomial.

	*	clearit(..);
		For freeing the linked list.
